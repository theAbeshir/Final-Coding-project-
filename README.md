Problem 4: Restaurant Transactions by Time of Day: We have a dataset of time-stamped transactions from a restaurant. We would like to know what are the top 5 most popular items by time period, according to the following 5 categories: 1) morning rush (opening to 9a), 2) morning (between 9a and 12p), 3) lunch rush (12-2p), 4) afternoon (between 2p and 6p) 5) dinner rush (6-8p), and 6) night (8p to close). We want a final dataset we can explore with this information (transformed from the original dataset), and an answer to our question. NOTE: the time periods are not in the original dataset (only time stamps), so you will need to compute them. We want to save these results in two files: 1) a .csv that holds the transformed dataset, and 2) a .txt file that contains the summarized report of the top 5 most popular items by period.
